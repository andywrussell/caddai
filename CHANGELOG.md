## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository bootstrap (M0): project structure, documentation set, multi-agent
  development team (`.github/agents/`), quality-gate tooling, `uv`-managed
  `pyproject.toml`, and the minimal `caddai` package skeleton.
- GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) running the quality
  gate on pull requests targeting `main` and on pushes to `main`.
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` and a feature/milestone request issue
  template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`).

### Changed

- Migrated CI/collaboration infrastructure from GitLab to GitHub: removed
  `.gitlab-ci.yml`; updated `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`,
  `docs/development-workflow.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and the
  Orchestrator/Integrator agent definitions to reference GitHub Actions CI
  and GitHub pull requests as the standard mechanisms.
