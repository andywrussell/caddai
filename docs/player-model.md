# Player model

> Status: a minimal M1 vertical slice now exists —
> [src/caddai/player/models.py](../src/caddai/player/models.py) defines
> `Club` (with a single scalar `expected_carry_metres` placeholder, not a
> distribution) and `Player`. The full carry-distribution/dispersion
> statistics design below remains **planned** for milestone M3;
> `src/caddai/statistics/` does not exist yet.

## Purpose

Represent a player's clubs, ability, and shot statistics so the strategy
engine can reason about what a specific player is likely to achieve with a
given shot.

## Owner

Player Engineer (see `.github/agents/player-engineer.agent.md`).

## Planned responsibilities

- **Player** domain model: identity, skill level, and owned clubs.
- **Club** domain model: club identifier/type and its carry distribution.
- **Carry distribution**: statistical model of distance (metres) achieved
  with a club, including variance — informs Monte Carlo simulation in M4.
- **Directional dispersion**: lateral/directional bias and spread for a
  club/player combination.
- **Performance history**: historical shot/round data feeding into
  statistical estimates (data model only at this stage — no storage
  technology selected; storage design is deferred to M6, see
  `decision-journal.md`).
- **Round statistics**: aggregate stats derived from a player's rounds
  (e.g. average proximity to target by club/distance band).

## Explicit non-goals

- No course geometry or GeoJSON parsing — that is the Course Engineer's
  responsibility.
- No caddie natural-language generation — that is the future `llm`
  subsystem's responsibility.
- No dependency on `course`, `strategy`, `simulation`, `llm`, `api`, or `cli`.

## Statistical approach (planned)

Carry and dispersion models will be represented as parametric distributions
(e.g. mean/variance, or empirical samples) computed with NumPy. Any
stochastic sampling introduced here (or consumed by `simulation`) must accept
an explicit random seed and be reproducible in tests, per
`.github/instructions/tests.instructions.md`.

## Units

All distances are in metres internally, consistent with `AGENTS.md` §5.
